# Kanbanery - time tracking with pomodoro extension

LIB in progress

## TODOS

* Listen for new tasks and attach pomodoro icon
  * This is tricky, not sure how to accomplish that
* Better overview log page
  * Add real times
* What is better: 
  Keeping logs per project or in one localStorage, hmm ?
